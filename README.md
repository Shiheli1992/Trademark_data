# Trademark_data
This dataset is the very preliminary version of the trademark-CRSP matching done by Po-Hsuan Hsu (National Tsing Hua U.: pohsuanhsu@mx.nthu.edu.tw) and Shihe Li (Adelaide University: shihe.li@adelaide.edu.au)

We hope that you will be able to get the most out of this dataset. All different dimensions and associated indicators based on USTPO trademark datasets can be used to capture firms’ product development (new trademarks for new product lines), product lines (existing trademarks of different classes), marketing strategies (full spectrum or only niche market), varieties (different brands of the same product), commercialization of inventions, etc. 

If you use this dataset for your research, please acknowledge Po-Hsuan Hsu and Shihe Li for sharing the dataset, which is based on and extends Po’s earlier work in trademarks:

If you have any question in this dataset, please contact Po. We will gather all issues and fix them in the next version.
